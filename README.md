# RichDAO
A DAO template project that allows everyday users to connect their algorand wallet and create a dao (similar to https://astrodao.com/)

A lot of this project code came from https://github.com/ipaleka/algodjango, I've edited much of the models but I have ran out of time to finish this before the hackathon ends. It is a project that could become something very similar to astrodao.com and I'm considering submitting it for grant funding to finish, but I decided to submit it for the hackathon to possibly catch some eyes.
This project is for the gitcoin bounty https://gitcoin.co/issue/algorandfoundation/grow-algorand/133/100027513


#TODO
Need to apply algorand wallet integration 
Updating HTML and css, learning how to integrate react with a django project
need to update database functionality (create DAO model)




##THIS PROJECT SHOULD NOT BE USED IN A PRODUCTION SETTING
